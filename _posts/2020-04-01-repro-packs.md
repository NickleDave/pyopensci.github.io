## examples of real-world repro-packs

Since you have already kindly listened to me this far, let me attempt to pay
you back by providing you with something more concrete than my straw-man
answers.

I did ask people on Twitter for some field specific examples of Python projects,
not because I thought I would be able to build that Carefully Curated Repository
all on my own, but because it would at least
help me see if I even have a question worth answering.

I still think I do, and it's not just because I told [Leah]() I would write
a blog post.

I specifically asked for "real-world repro-packs". They were on my mind because
I (was fortunate enough to have) just attended the URSSI Winter School, and
heard Karthik Ram talk about Reproducibilty Compendiums (same idea, different
name.)

I walk you through the examples
